## M64
The data of any M64 file is presented in a simple interface.
To change the data, select Read-write mode by clicking on the upper left checkbox.

You can save a modified copy of the selected M64 by clicking the bottom left button "Save M64"

### Header
You can view and edit all meaningful M64 Header data.

You can view and edit M64 Joystick Inputs on each frame in a clean, interactive TASInput style interface.
There are no major QoL features for Inputting on Joystick or Buttons as this is not TASing software.

You can seek back and forth, reverse playback, step frames and more intuitive controls.
Playing the movie back in real-time (30 FPS) is also possible.

### TAS Studio
You can view all inputs in a neatly arranged grid

### Advanced

You can change the raw input value at a frame using a unsafe debug menu.
