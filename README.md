## ⚙️ Feature-rich Utility application for Mupen64 ⚙️</b> 


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aurumaker72/MupenUtilities/multicontroller/app.PNG)
`M64 Editor 2021 Refurbished Epic Edition`

## M64
The data of any M64 file is presented in a simple interface.
To change the data, select Read-write mode by clicking on the upper left checkbox.

You can save a modified copy of the selected M64 by clicking the bottom left button "Save M64"

### Header
You can view and edit all meaningful M64 Header data such as
- Rerecords
- Plugin names
- Author
- Description
- Controller Flags
  - Enabled
  - Mempak
  - Rumblepak
- All else...


### Input
You can view and edit all M64 Inputs on each frame in a clean, interactive TASInput style interface.
Modifying the controller flags is possible too, for example enabling or disabling a controller, its' mempak and rumblepak

### Hex Viewer
View any byte (offset) of the selected movie as hexadecimal string.

This opens up limitless possibilities of finding data in a movie file.

### Frame Control
You can seek back and forth, reverse playback, step frames and more intuitive controls.

Playing the movie back in real-time (30 FPS) is also possible.

### Replacement
Same as M64 Editors' "Replacement" feature. Allows you to replace any sequence of frames from one movie to another. 

### TAS Studio
You can view all inputs in a neatly arranged and compacter grid. 

This is useful for those who don't want to waste time skimming through the movie

### Advanced
Dump a movie's raw input data to a file.

Change the raw input value at any frame in a debug menu located under "More" button.

Get the raw input value at any frame in a dialog located under "More" button. 

## Savestate

### RDRAM
View and edit savestates' RDRAM section. You can save and block special addresses to make it easier to remember what goes where.

Hook into mupen64 process memory and view some data like version string.
