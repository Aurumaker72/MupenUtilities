![MupenUtilities](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aurumaker72/MupenUtilities/input-roll/screenshot1.PNG "Mupen64 Utilities")<br>
Utility app for [Mupen64](https://github.com/mkdasher/mupen64-rr-lua-/)<br>
This can be seen as a continuation of the M64 Editor by [mkdasher](https://github.com/mkdasher/)

## M64
The data of any M64 file is presented in a simple interface.

#### Header
You can view and edit all meaningful M64 Header data.

#### Input
You can view and edit M64 Joystick Inputs on each frame in a clean, interactive TASInput style interface.
There are no major QoL features for Inputting on Joystick or Buttons as this is not TASing software 

#### Frame Control
You can seek back and forth, reverse playback, step frames and more intuitive controls.
Playing the movie back in real-time (30 FPS) is also possible.

#### Replacement
Same as M64 Editors' "Replacement" feature. Allows you to replace any sequence of input frames from one movie to another

#### TAS Studio
You can view all inputs in a neatly arranged grid

#### Advanced
You can dump a movie's raw input data to a file.
You can change the raw input value at a frame using a unsafe debug menu.
