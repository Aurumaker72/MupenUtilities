WIP utility app for [Mupen64](https://github.com/mkdasher/mupen64-rr-lua-/)<br>
This can be seen as a continuation of the M64 Editor by [mkdasher](https://github.com/mkdasher/)

## M64
The data of any M64 file is presented in a simple interface.
The edited input/header data can be saved to a new M64.

#### Header
You can view and edit all meaningful M64 Header data.

#### Input
You can view and edit M64 Joystick Inputs on each frame in a clean, interactive TASInput style interface.

#### Frame Control
You can seek back and forth, reverse playback, step frames and more intuitive controls.
Playing the movie back in real-time (30 FPS) is also possible.

#### Advanced
You can dump a movie's raw input data to a file if you are a nerd

## Other
There are in-app tips and tricks for usage.
This program checks for updates!
