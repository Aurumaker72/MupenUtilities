## ‚öôÔ∏è Feature-rich Utility application for Mupen64 ‚öôÔ∏è</b> 


![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Aurumaker72/MupenUtilities/multicontroller/app.PNG)
`M64 Editor 2021 Refurbished Epic Edition`

## M64
The data of any M64 file is presented in a simple interface.
To change the data, select Read-write mode by clicking on the upper left checkbox.

You can save a modified copy of the selected M64 by clicking the bottom left button "Save M64"

### Header
You can view and edit all meaningful M64 Header data such as
- Rerecords
- Plugin names
- Author
- Description
- Controller Flags
  - Enabled
  - Mempak
  - Rumblepak
- All else...


### Input
You can view and edit all M64 Inputs on each frame in a clean, interactive TASInput style interface.
Modifying the controller flags is possible too, for example enabling or disabling a controller, its' mempak and rumblepak

### Hex Viewer
View any byte (offset) of the selected movie as hexadecimal string.

This opens up limitless possibilities of finding data in a movie file.

### Frame Control
You can seek back and forth, reverse playback, step frames and more intuitive controls.

Playing the movie back in real-time (30 FPS) is also possible.

### Replacement
Same as M64 Editors' "Replacement" feature. Allows you to replace any sequence of frames from one movie to another. 

### TAS Studio
You can view all inputs in a neatly arranged and compacter grid. 

This is useful for those who don't want to waste time skimming through the movie

### Advanced
Dump a movie's raw input data to a file.

Change the raw input value at any frame in a debug menu located under "More" button.

Get the raw input value at any frame in a dialog located under "More" button. 

## Savestate

### RDRAM
View and edit savestates' RDRAM section. You can save and block special addresses to make it easier to remember what goes where.
